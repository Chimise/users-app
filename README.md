## Project Essence
This project was developed as part of the First Academy Tech 2.0 Software Engineering Track, specially for Angular End of Course project. It was prepared by Group 2, comprising of six(6) members showcasing their skills and understanding of building a unique user application using the Angular Framework. The application aims to provide a user details page showing a grid of users with their images and data.

## Overview
This project involves creating an Angular application with two main parts: a personal
landing page and a user data page. The landing page will allow you to summarize what
you have learned or introduce yourself. The second part will be a user data page,
displaying a list of users fetched from an API. This project aims to reinforce your skills
in Angular, including components, routing, HTTP Client, data handling, and personal
creativity in web development.


## Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed on your machine before setting up the application:
* IDE(VS code preferred)
* NodeJs

## Features
- Landing Page: The landing page shows the navigation bar that allows the navigating to the user details page and the home page. It also summarizes what the students have learnt through the angular course.
- User data page: This page shows a list of users fetched from a RESTful API. This was implemented using an HTTP client to fetch data from [json-placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
- User Routing: This feature enables the routing of a user when clicked upon from the users data page..
